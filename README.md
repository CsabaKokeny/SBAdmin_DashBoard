sb-admin-2
==========

A Bootstrap based admin theme, dashboard, or web application UI from [startbootstrap.com](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/).

The goal of this fork is to decompose the theme into a set of AngularJS directives. The navbar and sidebar have been re-created in [eeh-navigation](https://github.com/ethanhann/eeh-navigation).

Scaffolding was done with [Swiip/generator-gulp-angular](https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular).
